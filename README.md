# What is this?

As much as I remember, since [this project](https://github.com/Mohammad-Reihani/Quine-McCluskey) was originally meant to be deployed on `Arduino UNO`-as the interface for keyboard I guess- and, because of the lack of memory, `ESP8266`, acting as the brain and display manger (simple 16c lcd), so `that project` I mentioned above, is just the C code I wrote for calculations, and I guess this one is the codes for communication between these two eval boards and utilizing them thats it.
